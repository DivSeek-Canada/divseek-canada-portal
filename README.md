# Galaxy/Apollo

This docker-compose.yml file specifies all of the infrastructure needed to run
the current iteration of GMOD products.

We have attempted to include as many "bells and whistles" as possible, which
means this approaches the level of "tech-demo" and away from something you
might wish to deploy as-is. That said, the deployment is very easy to customise
and adapt to your particular organisation's needs.

**Galaxy** ...

![](./media/galaxy.png)

... allows you to load data in **Apollo**,

![](./media/apollo.png)

which in turn can be exported to **Chado** and **Tripal**.

But wait, there's more! Data in Chado is made available in **JBrowse**

## Running

```console
$ docker-compose pull # Pull all images
$ docker-compose up -d apollo_db tripal_db # Launch the DBs
```

In a new terminal, in the same folder, run `docker-compose logs -f` in order to
watch what is going on.

```
$ docker-compose up -d tripal # Wait for tripal to come up and install Chado.
$ # It takes a few minutes. I believe you'll see an apache error when ready.
$ docker-compose up -d # This will bring up the rest of the services.
```
